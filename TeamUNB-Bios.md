Ngoc Phan (Jennie)

I'm currently pursuing my Master of Engineering degree at the Department of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering at the University of New Brunswick. This semester marks the culmination of my academic journey. Alongside my studies, I've been engaged as a part-time Geomatics Analyst, contributing to the development of a Historical Database covering the principal cities of New Brunswick: Fredericton, Saint John, and Moncton. Additionally, I've been actively involved in the Esri Canada Centre of Excellence Student Associate program for the past two years. Beyond academics and professional endeavors, I have a keen interest in travel, literature, music, sports, as well as technology and its innovative applications.
