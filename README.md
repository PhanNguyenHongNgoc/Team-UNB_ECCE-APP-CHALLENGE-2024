## App overview
The 'Fredericton Climate Change 3D FloodWatch' will provide an overview of the predicted flood levels for the year 2100 in downtown Fredericton, New Brunswick, due to climate change. We have summarized the data for the recent buildings constructed 3D buildings in Fredericton, NB, including essential features such as flood depth, building height, age, and address. These buildings are at risk of being submerged by flood events in 2100.
Given the trends in climate change, urban development, including impermeable paving, is exacerbating the city's vulnerability to flooding. Factors such as heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, ice jams, storm surges, and climate change are increasing the risk of flooding in Fredericton in the coming decades. The integrated 3D flood model, combined with the 3D building model, offers decision-makers a strategic framework for planning and implementation. This framework includes a timeline for action to address the challenges posed by future flooding events.

## Offline Map
Utilizing the Lidar point cloud data gathered via the GEONB platform, we conducted an analysis to manage urban expansion and flood risk within a 3D scene. This section elucidates the detailed process involved in processing this database and generating the 3D scene Web App.

1. Lidar Point Cloud Collection: The Lidar point cloud was systematically collected within the central area of downtown Fredericton, near the Saint John River. This strategic collection site resides within a flood zone, offering a clear depiction of flood behavior around buildings and residential areas.

2. Elevation Model Creation and Building Height Calculation: The Lidar point cloud underwent classification into distinct categories:
o    Ground Points: Aimed at acquiring ground-level data to generate a Digital Terrain Model (DTM).
o    First Return Points: Representing the foremost laser pulse returns, capturing significant landscape features such as treetops or building summits to construct a Digital Surface Model (DSM). Leveraging the DTM and DSM obtained in prior stages, a normalized DSM (n_DSM) was generated by subtracting DTM values from DSM values, yielding the building height data.

3. Footprint Data Compilation and Urban Expansion Analysis: Historical footprint data sourced from Fredericton city archives spanning from 1631 to 2024 were collected and categorized into distinct periods to observe urban expansion trends. The previously calculated building height data was directly integrated into the footprint polygons, facilitating the extrusion of 3D buildings.

4. Predictable Flood Model Integration: A flood model depicting the projected flood scenario for 2100, obtained from the GENB platform, with an average water level of approximately 9 meters was incorporated. Consequently, a 3D flood model was developed, reflecting a 9-meter elevation in water levels by the year 2100.

Upon completion of the process, the 3D building and flood models were overlaid, illustrating the inundation impact on each building. This information is accessible via the attribute table of each building, featuring a designated field titled 'Flood Depth'.

#  App Features
You can view the 3D model from a global or local perspective and observe it from different angles, including along the flood zone.
